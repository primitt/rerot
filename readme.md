# ReRot
## An english -> brainrot/text slang translator

### Technologies
* TogetherAI (For translation)
* Python Flask (For backend tasks)
* Jquery (Form submission and data retrieval)

### How to run?

Step 1: Make sure you have `python 3.9` installed.

Step 2: Download the requirements:

```python3 -m pip install flask together python-dotenv```

Step 3: Get an API key from together.ai and put it into a `.env` file in the project directory
```together_key=....```

Step 4: Run the python file!

```python3 main.py```

That's it!

### Why?

The real question is why not? We are living in a day and age where brainrot is used everywhere from social media to real life, and sometimes you need "some aura to rizz up the huzz", and ReRot can give you just that.
Anyways, as you can tell, this is just a for fun project and has no real use in daily life.
